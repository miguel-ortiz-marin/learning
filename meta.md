The purpose of this project is to document my learning journey. In principle, I write this for myself. To structure my knowledge and direct future efforts. I also aim for this to be useful for anyone that would be interested in following a similar path.

For some context: In 2016 I started a **Systems Engineering and Computation (CompSci)** BSc and graduated in 2021:

- With a project based learning, creating complex software systems, I developed the ability to quickly learn any programming language, which is rooted in deep understanding of theorical aspects of Computer Science, Math and Software Engineering.
- In 2019, I traveled for one week to San Francisco with Marconi Society thanks to their Celestini Program. There I met Computer Science legends among Vinc Cerf, and the recepients of the 2019 Marconi Society awards Taher Elgamal and Paul Kocher.
- I originally desired to study Computer Science, the career didn't exist in Colombia when I graduated from school, and the career was only made available ~4 years after. The second option was a "math minor". I took a formal math (proof-oriented) and probabiltiy course, but contunity was made impossible by faculty restricting courses to only math majors (A **very, very bad** choice by the faculty, imo). I didn't have the guts to continue this path as I wanted a more applied approached and feared taking longer than expected to graduate (among other fears).
- My problem solving and more mathematical interests would have been satisfied by my participation in competitive programming and starting machine learning early. In 2018 I took first place in the ICPS national, which requires very strong algorithms and data structures domain. Among this time I also started contributing to MindLab, the top ML lab in UNAL.  

My main interests are computational and theoretical physics, specially quantum molecular simulation and quantum inspired machine learning.

## Leadership and communication

- UCHICAGO teaches the top-down approach to communication:

- How to Speak - MIT Open Courseware - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY&t=421s&ab_channel=MITOpenCourseWare

## Physics Roadmap
- How to become a GOOD Theoretical Physicist - Gerardus 't Hooft 1999 Physics Nobel - https://webspace.science.uu.nl/~gadda001/goodtheorist/index.html
- Assuming you know a fair bit of calculus, Steven Brunton lectures starting with Math Engineering on Differential Eq, SVD, Fourier Analysis will give you the intuition you wished you had been taught.
- Coming from a Computer Science background, covering gaps in math (e.g with Steven's lectures)

## Japanese

- RTK


Initially I decided to study computer science, however the bachelor didn't exist in Colombia UNAl at 2015, by the time I joined there were men
