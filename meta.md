The purpose of this project is to document my learning journey. In principle, I write this for myself. To structure my knowledge and direct future efforts. I also aim for this to be useful for anyone that would be interested in following a similar path. 

Read the summary to find out if this will be valuable for you:

For context: In 2016 I started a **Systems Engineering and Computation (CompSci)** BSc and graduated in 2021. Right now I am moving into applied physics/math. My main interests are applied math, computational and theoretical physics, quantum molecular simulation and quantum inspired machine learning.


If you want a bit more details on my journey, read the following section, otherwise you can skip!

- I focused a lot in project based learning. First defining a goal, a problem to solve, designing and creating from the ground up complex software systems. With it, I developed the ability to quickly learn any dev tool/programming language, which is rooted in deep understanding of fundamental concepts/first principles thinking, theorical aspects of Computer Science, Math and Software Engineering. One of the most *cool* systems I built with friends was a multi-platform online video game (web + mobile)
- In 2019, I traveled for one week to San Francisco with Marconi Society thanks to their Celestini Program. There I met Computer Science legends among Vinc Cerf, and the recepients of the 2019 Marconi Society awards Taher Elgamal and Paul Kocher.
- I originally desired to study Computer Science (initally motivated by an interest in developing video games and later by the Imitation Game and The Social Network movies). However, the career didn't exist in Colombia when I finished high school, and it was only made available ~4 years after. The second option was a "math minor". I took a formal math (proof-oriented) and probabiltiy course, but contunity was made impossible by faculty restricting courses to only math majors (A **very, very bad** choice by the faculty, imo; A very brigth colleague followed this with success). I didn't have the guts to continue this path, I wanted a more applied approached and feared taking longer than expected to graduate (among other fears).
- My problem solving and more mathematical interests would have been satisfied by my participation in competitive programming and starting machine learning early. In 2018 I took first place in the ICPC national, which requires very strong algorithms and data structures domain. Among this time I also started contributing to MindLab, the top ML lab in UNAL.
- The Covid years were (expectedly) dark for me, emotionally, academically and financially (I was heavy into crypto, won and lost). I dropped competitive programming (a heavy heart decision) and took a shift into Quantum Computing with Qubit by Qubit by the coding school and graduate coursework with Fabio Gonzalez (MindLab Leader).
- Motivated by heartbreak, I invested a lot into self-development and before graduating I found myself starting a position as Junior Data Scientist at QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey Bogot√° Office. There I've gained a lot of practical experience in machine learning in banking and B2B industries.
- On my "free time" I took to learn mainly QC, I partaked in all the IBM quantum challenges I could, gained the qiskit certification and even won 2nd place at one MIT Quantum Computing hackathon.
- Now, I'm taking self-learning more seriously (and via extension writing about it). I'm filling my knowledge gaps in math and physics with formal books. I also picked up weight lifting and have been progressing nicely. Even though the *quantum advantage* is still uncertain, I'm convinced that thoroughly and correctly learning the material will improve anyone chances to make interesting contributions to their respective fields ML.
- So far, I've revisited Linear Algebra (Strang), Calculus (Steven Brunton). And learning more advanced topics (e.g Differential Equations (also Steven Brunton) and Quantum Chemistry (Attila and Szabo; TMPChem), QCQI (Nielsen and Chuang)

Below are some links to meta-articles, summaries of ideas and lectures that guide my thought.

# Guiding principles

- Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less - Greg McKown - your biggest priority is protecting the asset, mainting your ability to prioritize the essential aspects of your life, and to do less, but better.
- Maps of meaning - Jordan Peterson - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL22J3VaeABQCn5nTAx65NRlh1EsKD0UQD. Aim at something 
- Carl Jung Path of Indiviuation - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx_60kIXLIU&ab_channel=AcademyofIdeas. We musn't focus on perfection, but on completion of the psyche.

## Leadership and communication

- UCHICAGO teaches the top-down approach to communication:
  - LEADERSHIP LAB: The Craft of Writing Effectively https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM&ab_channel=UChicagoSocialSciences
- How to Speak - MIT Open Courseware - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY&t=421s&ab_channel=MITOpenCourseWare

## Physics/Quantum Roadmap
- How to become a GOOD Theoretical Physicist - Gerardus 't Hooft 1999 Physics Nobel - https://webspace.science.uu.nl/~gadda001/goodtheorist/index.html
- Assuming you know a fair bit of calculus, Steven Brunton lectures starting with Math Engineering on Differential Eq, SVD, Fourier Analysis will give you the intuition you wished you had been taught. You can start right ahead with quantum computing using materials like qiskit textbook, then read QCQI (**do the exercises**) at the same time chemistry and math gaps are filled. You'll appreciate the material much more with a differential equations and physical chemistry understanding.
