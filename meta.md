The purpose of this project is to document my learning journey. In principle, I write this for myself. To structure my knowledge and direct future efforts. I also aim for this to be useful for anyone that would be interested in following a similar path. In summary, I have a CompSci background moving into applied physics/math. My main interests are applied math, computational and theoretical physics, quantum molecular simulation and quantum inspired machine learning. 

For some context: In 2016 I started a **Systems Engineering and Computation (CompSci)** BSc and graduated in 2021:

- With a project based learning, creating complex software systems, I developed the ability to quickly learn any programming language, which is rooted in deep understanding of theorical aspects of Computer Science, Math and Software Engineering.
- In 2019, I traveled for one week to San Francisco with Marconi Society thanks to their Celestini Program. There I met Computer Science legends among Vinc Cerf, and the recepients of the 2019 Marconi Society awards Taher Elgamal and Paul Kocher.
- I originally desired to study Computer Science (initally motivated by an interest in developing video games and later by the Imitation Game and The Social Network movies). However, the career didn't exist in Colombia when I finished high school, and it was only made available ~4 years after. The second option was a "math minor". I took a formal math (proof-oriented) and probabiltiy course, but contunity was made impossible by faculty restricting courses to only math majors (A **very, very bad** choice by the faculty, imo; A very brigth colleague followed this with success). I didn't have the guts to continue this path, I wanted a more applied approached and feared taking longer than expected to graduate (among other fears).
- My problem solving and more mathematical interests would have been satisfied by my participation in competitive programming and starting machine learning early. In 2018 I took first place in the ICPC national, which requires very strong algorithms and data structures domain. Among this time I also started contributing to MindLab, the top ML lab in UNAL.
- The Covid years were (expectedly) dark for me, emotionally, academically and financially (I was heavy into crypto, won and lost). I dropped competitive programming (a heavy heart decision) and took a shift into Quantum Computing with Qubit by Qubit by the coding school and graduate coursework with Fabio Gonzalez (MindLab Leader).
- Motivated by heartbreak, I invested a lot into self-development and before graduating I found myself starting a position as Junior Data Scientist at QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey Bogot√° Office. There I've gained a lot of practical experience in machine learning in banking and B2B industries.
- On my "free time" I took to learn mainly QC, I partaked in all the IBM quantum challenges I could, gained the qiskit certification and even won 2nd place at one MIT Quantum Computing hackathon.
- Now, I'm taking self-learning more seriously (and via extension writing about it). I'm filling my knowledge gaps in math and physics with formal books. I also picked up weight lifting and have been progressing nicely. 

Below are some links to meta-articles, summaries of ideas and lectures that guide my thought.

## Leadership and communication

- UCHICAGO teaches the top-down approach to communication:

- How to Speak - MIT Open Courseware - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY&t=421s&ab_channel=MITOpenCourseWare

## Physics Roadmap
- How to become a GOOD Theoretical Physicist - Gerardus 't Hooft 1999 Physics Nobel - https://webspace.science.uu.nl/~gadda001/goodtheorist/index.html
- Assuming you know a fair bit of calculus, Steven Brunton lectures starting with Math Engineering on Differential Eq, SVD, Fourier Analysis will give you the intuition you wished you had been taught.
